# Writing HMR/Dev Server tests

Dev server tests validate that hot-reloading is robust, correct, and reliable. Remember to write thorough, yet concise tests.

## File Structure

- `test/bake/bake-harness.ts` - shared utilities and test harness
  - primary test functions `devTest` / `prodTest` / `devAndProductionTest`
  - class `Dev` (controls subprocess for dev server)
  - class `Client` (controls a happy-dom subprocess for having the page open)
  - more helpers
- `test/bake/client-fixture.mjs` - subprocess for what `Client` controls. it loads a page and uses IPC to query parts of the page, run javascript, and much more.
- `test/bake/dev/*.test.ts` - these call `devTest` to test dev server and hot reloading
- `test/bake/dev-and-prod.ts` - these use `devAndProductionTest` to run the same test on dev and production mode. these tests cannot really test hot reloading for obvious reasons.

## Categories

bundle.test.ts - Bundle tests are tests concerning bundling bugs that only occur in DevServer.
css.test.ts - CSS tests concern bundling bugs with CSS files
plugins.test.ts - Plugin tests concern plugins in development mode.
ecosystem.test.ts - These tests involve ensuring certain libraries are correct. It is preferred to test more concrete bugs than testing entire packages.
esm.test.ts - ESM tests are about various esm features in development mode.
html.test.ts - HTML tests are tests relating to HTML files themselves.
react-spa.test.ts - Tests relating to React, our react-refresh transform, and basic server component transforms.
sourcemap.test.ts - Tests verifying source-maps are correct.

## `devTest` Basics

A test takes in two primary inputs: `files` and `async test(dev) {`

```ts
import { devTest, emptyHtmlFile } from "../bake-harness";

devTest("html file is watched", {
  files: {
    "index.html": emptyHtmlFile({
      scripts: ["/script.ts"],
      body: "<h1>Hello</h1>",
    }),
    "script.ts": `
      console.log("hello");
    `,
  },
  async test(dev) {
    await dev.fetch("/").expect.toInclude("<h1>Hello</h1>");
    await dev.fetch("/").expect.toInclude("<h1>Hello</h1>");
    await dev.patch("index.html", {
      find: "Hello",
      replace: "World",
    });
    await dev.fetch("/").expect.toInclude("<h1>World</h1>");

    // Works
    await using c = await dev.client("/");
    await c.expectMessage("hello");

    // Editing HTML reloads
    await c.expectReload(async () => {
      await dev.patch("index.html", {
        find: "World",
        replace: "Hello",
      });
      await dev.fetch("/").expect.toInclude("<h1>Hello</h1>");
    });
    await c.expectMessage("hello");

    await c.expectReload(async () => {
      await dev.patch("index.html", {
        find: "Hello",
        replace: "Bar",
      });
      await dev.fetch("/").expect.toInclude("<h1>Bar</h1>");
    });
    await c.expectMessage("hello");

    await c.expectReload(async () => {
      await dev.patch("script.ts", {
        find: "hello",
        replace: "world",
      });
    });
    await c.expectMessage("world");
  },
});
```

`files` holds the initial state, and the callback runs with the server running. `dev.fetch()` runs HTTP requests, while `dev.client()` opens a browser instance to the code.

Functions `dev.write` and `dev.patch` and `dev.delete` mutate the filesystem. Do not use `node:fs` APIs, as the dev server ones are hooked to wait for hot-reload, and all connected clients to receive changes.

When a change performs a hard-reload, that must be explicitly annotated with `expectReload`. This tells `client-fixture.mjs` that the test is meant to reload the page once; All other hard reloads automatically fail the test.

Client's have `console.log` instrumented, so that any unasserted logs fail the test. This makes it more obvious when an extra reload or re-evaluation. Messages are awaited via `c.expectMessage("log")` or with multiple arguments if there are multiple logs.

## Testing for bundling errors

By default, a client opening a page to an error will fail the test. This makes testing errors explicit.

```ts
devTest("import then create", {
  files: {
    "index.html": `
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <head></head>
      <body>
        <script type="module" src="/script.ts"></script>
      </body>
      </html>
    `,
    "script.ts": `
      import data from "./data";
      console.log(data);
    `,
  },
  async test(dev) {
    const c = await dev.client("/", {
      errors: ['script.ts:1:18: error: Could not resolve: "./data"'],
    });
    await c.expectReload(async () => {
      await dev.write("data.ts", "export default 'data';");
    });
    await c.expectMessage("data");
  },
});
```

Many functions take an options value to allow specifying it will produce errors. For example, this delete is going to cause a resolution failure.

```ts
await dev.delete("other.ts", {
  errors: ['index.ts:1:16: error: Could not resolve: "./other"'],
});
```
