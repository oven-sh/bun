# Writing tests for Bun

## Where tests are found

You'll find all of Bun's tests in the `test/` directory.

* `test/`
  * `cli/` - CLI command tests, like `bun install` or `bun init`
  * `js/` - JavaScript & TypeScript tests
    * `bun/` - `Bun` APIs tests, separated by category, for example: `glob/` for `Bun.Glob` tests
    * `node/` - Node.js module tests, separated by module, for example: `assert/` for `node:assert` tests
      * `test/` - Vendored Node.js tests, taken from the Node.js repository (does not conform to Bun's test style)
    * `web/` - Web API tests, separated by category, for example: `fetch/` for `Request` and `Response` tests
    * `third_party/` - npm package tests, to validate that basic usage works in Bun
  * `napi/` - N-API tests
  * `v8/` - V8 C++ API tests
  * `bundler/` - Bundler, transpiler, CSS, and `bun build` tests
  * `regression/issue/[number]` - Regression tests, always make one when fixing a particular issue

## How tests are written

Bun's tests are written as JavaScript and TypeScript files with the Jest-style APIs, like `test`, `describe`, and `expect`. They are tested using Bun's own test runner, `bun test`. 

```js
import { describe, test, expect } from "bun:test";
import assert, { AssertionError } from "assert";

describe("assert(expr)", () => {
  test.each([true, 1, "foo"])(`assert(%p) does not throw`, expr => {
    expect(() => assert(expr)).not.toThrow();
  });

  test.each([false, 0, "", null, undefined])(`assert(%p) throws`, expr => {
    expect(() => assert(expr)).toThrow(AssertionError);
  });
});
```

## Testing conventions

* See `test/harness.ts` for common test utilities and helpers
* Be rigorous and test for edge-cases and unexpected inputs
* Use data-driven tests, e.g. `test.each`, to reduce boilerplate when possible
* When you need to test Bun as a CLI, use the following pattern:

```js
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";
import { spawn } from "bun";
import { bunExe, bunEnv } from "harness";

test("bun --version", async () => {
  const { exited, stdout: stdoutStream, stderr: stderrStream } = spawn({
    cmd: [bunExe(), "--version"],
    env: bunEnv,
    stdout: "pipe",
    stderr: "pipe",
  });
  const [ exitCode, stdout, stderr ] = await Promise.all([
    exited,
    new Response(stdoutStream).text(),
    new Response(stderrStream).text(),
  ]);
  expect({ exitCode, stdout, stderr }).toMatchObject({
    exitCode: 0,
    stdout: expect.stringContaining(Bun.version),
    stderr: "",
  });
});
```

## Before writing a test

* If you are fixing a bug, write the test first and make sure it fails (as expected) with the canary version of Bun
* If you are fixing a Node.js compatibility bug, create a throw-away snippet of code and test that it works as you expect in Node.js, then that it fails (as expected) with the canary version of Bun
* When the expected behaviour is ambigious, defer to matching what happens in Node.js
* Always attempt to find related tests in an existing test file before creating a new test file
