# Fix for update-lshpack.yml GitHub Action

This document contains the fix for the broken `update-lshpack.yml` GitHub Action.

## Problem
The workflow was failing with: `Error: Could not fetch SHA for tag v2.3.4`

## Root Cause
The script assumed all Git tags are annotated tags that need dereferencing, but some tags are lightweight tags that point directly to commits.

## Fix Required
Replace lines 53-62 in `.github/workflows/update-lshpack.yml` with the improved tag handling logic that checks tag type before dereferencing.

## Manual Application
Apply the changes shown in the diff to fix the issue.
