# âœ… Shipped: `bun audit --fix`

## Summary

I've successfully implemented `bun audit --fix` functionality that automatically fixes security vulnerabilities in dependencies. The implementation leverages Bun's existing infrastructure for package updates while adding targeted vulnerability fixing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Command Line Interface

**File: `src/install/PackageManager/CommandLineArguments.zig`**

- Added `--fix` flag to audit command parameters
- Added `audit_flags` struct to store the fix flag state
- Updated help text to include the new `--fix` example
- Added parsing logic to set `audit_flags.fix` when `--fix` is passed

### 2. Core Implementation

**File: `src/cli/audit_command.zig`**

- Modified `exec()` to extract and pass the fix flag
- Updated `audit()` function signature to accept `fix: bool` parameter
- Added vulnerability parsing and fix logic when `--fix` is enabled
- Implemented `auditFix()` function that:
  - Analyzes vulnerable packages
  - Creates update requests for each vulnerable package
  - Uses existing `updatePackageJSONAndInstallWithManagerWithUpdatesAndUpdateRequests` infrastructure
  - Provides user feedback on fixes applied

### 3. Test Coverage

**File: `test/cli/install/bun-audit.test.ts`**

- Added test for fixing vulnerabilities with `--fix` flag
- Added test to ensure `--json` and `--fix` don't conflict
- Added test for `--fix` with no vulnerabilities
- Added test for fixing dev dependencies

## How It Works

1. **Run vulnerability scan** - Uses existing audit infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities
2. **Parse vulnerability data** - Extracts package names and vulnerable version ranges
3. **Create update requests** - Generates requests to update each vulnerable package
4. **Apply updates** - Uses Bun's existing update system to modify package.json and reinstall
5. **User feedback** - Shows progress and results of the fix operation

## Usage

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities (no changes)
$ bun audit

# Automatically fix vulnerabilities
$ bun audit --fix

# JSON output (fix is disabled with --json)
$ bun audit --json --fix
```

## Key Features

- **Automatic fixing** - One command to fix all fixable vulnerabilities
- **Leverages existing infrastructure** - Uses Bun's proven update system
- **Clear feedback** - Shows what's being fixed and the results
- **Safe by default** - Updates to latest version within constraints
- **Test coverage** - Comprehensive tests ensure reliability

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation is functional and ready to ship, future enhancements could include:

1. **Minimum safe version detection** - Query registry to find the exact minimum safe version
2. **--dry-run support** - Preview what would be fixed without making changes
3. **Transitive dependency handling** - Better support for fixing indirect vulnerabilities
4. **Breaking change detection** - Warn when fixes require major version updates
5. **Partial fix support** - Allow fixing specific vulnerabilities only

## Conclusion

The `bun audit --fix` command is now fully implemented and ready for use. It provides the essential functionality users need to quickly and safely fix security vulnerabilities in their dependencies, matching the convenience of `npm audit fix` while leveraging Bun's speed and efficiency.
