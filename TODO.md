- [x] consider splitting visitExpr the same way visitStmt is split up
- [x] consider modifying the functions to accept (comptime P: type) rather than the three seperate parser features flags
- [ ] remove template.zig
- [ ] remove js_parser_longest.zig
- [ ] remove @noRemoveUnused from any that still have it
- [ ] manually sort `P.xyz` imports (from `js_parser.NewParser_`) (using 'sort lines ascending') and remove unused ones
- [ ] ./vendor/zig/zig fmt src && bun scripts/sortImports src && bun scripts/glob-sources.mjs
- [ ] measure zig build time before & after (is it slower?)
- [ ] remove TODO.md
