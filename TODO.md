- [ ] issue-207.test.ts: update webkit to allow overridenDateNow to be negative. we will have to pick some other value to be none, eg NaN.

- [ ] process.hrtime (same as performance.now, resets to [0, 0] when fake timers are enabled)
- [ ] decimal ticks should be supported: https://github.com/sinonjs/fake-timers/blob/main/test/issue-207-test.js
- [ ] what happens when you add negative time?

- [ ] test abortsignal
- [ ] test spawnSync
- [ ] support performance.now
- [ ] support Date.now()
- [ ] support useFakeTimers in combination with setSystemTime
- [ ] support functions:
  - [x] advanceTimersByTime
  - [ ] advanceTimersByTimeAsync\*
  - [x] advanceTimersToNextTimer
  - [ ] advanceTimersToNextTimerAsync\*
  - [ ] advanceTimersToNextFrame
  - [x] getTimerCount
  - [x] clearAllTimers
  - [ ] getMockedSystemTime
  - [ ] getRealSystemTime
  - [ ] runAllTicks
  - [x] runAllTimers
  - [ ] runAllTimersAsync\*
  - [x] runOnlyPendingTimers
    - [x] make sure `[10, [20]], [30, [40]]` runs 10, 20, and 30
  - [ ] runOnlyPendingTimersAsync
  - [ ] setSystemTime
  - [x] useFakeTimers
  - [x] isFakeTimers
  - [x] useRealTimers
- [ ] the result of 'arm' ('.disarm'/'.rearm') seems to be ignored? both disarm and rearm? we should change it to return void if it's actually ignored
  - [ ] we can make this change seperately in main
- [ ] see how fake timers works with setSystemTime
- [ ] handle the config argument for useFakeTimers
  - vitest has the toFake parameter for enabling nextTick and queueMicrotask
  - jets has a timerLimit parameter
- [ ] make sure there is no memory leak if you create a setTimeout/setInterval and clear or stop the fake timers before it fires repeatedly.
- [ ] audit the allowFakeTimers list (do we want subprocess timeouts to count? and others)
  - we will also need some timespec.now() calls to exclude mocked time, ie `timespec.nowUnmocked()`
  - since test timeouts must be unmocked, we need BunTest timeouts to use unmocked time
  - [ ] audit all timespec.now() calls to replace some with timespec.nowUnmocked()
- [ ] add a test that fake timers do not break test duration calculations
- [ ] test the order of '0' timeouts, decide if we will match or not
  - [ ] consider supporting edge-case where `timeout0(A, timeout0(B)), timeout0(C)` prints `A=0, C=0, B=1` (date.now())
- [ ] \* support async functions (maybe defer these for later? the first PR does not need to have everything. we can stub the unimplemented functions.)
- [ ] add types for all functions
- [ ] add docs for all functions (at minimum: documentatino comments in the types)
- [ ] determine which tags should have timer-faking enabled (eg should subprocess timeout? probably not but maybe)
- [ ] find real projects using fake timers, see if they work
- [ ] make sure we match jest fake timers also
