[test]
# Large monorepos (like Bun) may want to specify the test directory more specifically 
# By default, `bun test` scans every single folder recurisvely which, if you
# have a gigantic submodule (like WebKit), it has to do lots of directory
# traversals
#
# Instead, we can just make it scan only the test directory for Bun's runtime tests
