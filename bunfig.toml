[test]
# Large monorepos (like Bun) may want to specify the test directory more specifically 
# By default, `bun test` scans every single folder recursively which, if you
# have a gigantic submodule (like WebKit), requires lots of directory
# traversals
#
# Instead, we can only scan the test directory for Bun's runtime tests
