Production servers often read, upload, and write files to S3-compatible object storage services instead of the local filesystem. Historically, that means local filesystem APIs you use in development can't be used in production. When you use Bun, things are different.

Bun provides fast, native bindings for interacting with S3-compatible object storage services. Bun's S3 API is designed to be simple and feel similar to fetch's `Response` and `Blob` APIs (like Bun's local filesystem APIs).

```ts
import { s3, write, S3 } from "bun";

const metadata = await s3("123.json", {
  accessKeyId: "your-access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "your-secret-key",
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  // endpoint: "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
});

// Download from S3 as JSON
const data = await metadata.json();

// Upload to S3
await write(metadata, JSON.stringify({ name: "John", age: 30 }));

// Presign a URL (synchronous - no network request needed)
const url = metadata.presign({
  acl: "public-read",
  expiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24, // 1 day
});
```

S3 is the [de facto standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto_standard) internet filesystem. You can use Bun's S3 API with S3-compatible storage services like:

- AWS S3
- Cloudflare R2
- DigitalOcean Spaces
- MinIO
- Backblaze B2
- ...and any other S3-compatible storage service

## Basic Usage

There are several ways to interact with Bun's S3 API.

### Using `Bun.s3()`

The `s3()` helper function is used to create one-off `S3File` instances for a single file.

```ts
import { s3 } from "bun";

// Using the s3() helper
const s3file = s3("my-file.txt", {
  accessKeyId: "your-access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "your-secret-key",
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  // endpoint: "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com", // optional
  // endpoint: "https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com", // Cloudflare R2
  // endpoint: "https://<region>.digitaloceanspaces.com", // DigitalOcean Spaces
  // endpoint: "http://localhost:9000", // MinIO
});
```

### Reading Files

You can read files from S3 using similar methods to Bun's file system APIs:

```ts
// Read an S3File as text
const text = await s3file.text();

// Read an S3File as JSON
const json = await s3file.json();

// Read an S3File as an ArrayBuffer
const buffer = await s3file.arrayBuffer();

// Get only the first 1024 bytes
const partial = await s3file.slice(0, 1024).text();

// Stream the file
const stream = s3file.stream();
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

## Writing Files

Writing to S3 is just as simple:

```ts
// Write a string (replacing the file)
await s3file.write("Hello World!");

// Write with content type
await s3file.write(JSON.stringify({ name: "John", age: 30 }), {
  type: "application/json",
});

// Write using a writer (streaming)
const writer = s3file.writer({ type: "application/json" });
writer.write("Hello");
writer.write(" World!");
await writer.end();

// Write using Bun.write
await Bun.write(s3file, "Hello World!");
```

### Working with large files (streams)

Bun automatically handles multipart uploads for large files and provides streaming capabilities. The same API that works for local files also works for S3 files.

```ts
// Write a large file
const bigFile = Buffer.alloc(10 * 1024 * 1024); // 10MB
const writer = s3file.writer({
  // Automatically retry on network errors up to 3 times
  retry: 3,

  // Queue up to 10 requests at a time
  queueSize: 10,

  // Upload in 5 MB chunks
  partSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024,
});
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  await writer.write(bigFile);
}
await writer.end();
```

## Presigning URLs

When your production service needs to let users upload files to your server, it's often more reliable for the user to upload directly to S3 instead of your server acting as an intermediary.

To facilitate this, you can presign URLs for S3 files. This generates a URL with a signature that allows a user to securely upload that specific file to S3, without exposing your credentials or granting them unnecessary access to your bucket.

```ts
// Generate a presigned URL that expires in 24 hours (default)
const url = s3file.presign();

// Custom expiration time (in seconds)
const url2 = s3file.presign({ expiresIn: 3600 }); // 1 hour

// Using static method
const url3 = Bun.S3.presign("my-file.txt", {
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  accessKeyId: "your-access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "your-secret-key",
  // endpoint: "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
  // endpoint: "https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com", // Cloudflare R2
  expiresIn: 3600,
});
```

### Setting ACLs

To set an ACL (access control list) on a presigned URL, pass the `acl` option:

```ts
const url = s3file.presign({
  acl: "public-read",
  expiresIn: 3600,
});
```

You can pass any of the following ACLs:

| ACL                           | Explanation                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"public-read"`               | The object is readable by the public.                               |
| `"private"`                   | The object is readable only by the bucket owner.                    |
| `"public-read-write"`         | The object is readable and writable by the public.                  |
| `"authenticated-read"`        | The object is readable by the bucket owner and authenticated users. |
| `"aws-exec-read"`             | The object is readable by the AWS account that made the request.    |
| `"bucket-owner-read"`         | The object is readable by the bucket owner.                         |
| `"bucket-owner-full-control"` | The object is readable and writable by the bucket owner.            |
| `"log-delivery-write"`        | The object is writable by AWS services used for log delivery.       |

### Expiring URLs

To set an expiration time for a presigned URL, pass the `expiresIn` option.

```ts
const url = s3file.presign({
  // Seconds
  expiresIn: 3600, // 1 hour
});
```

### `method`

To set the HTTP method for a presigned URL, pass the `method` option.

```ts
const url = s3file.presign({
  method: "PUT",
  // method: "DELETE",
  // method: "GET",
  // method: "HEAD",
  // method: "POST",
  // method: "PUT",
});
```

### `new Response(S3File)`

To quickly redirect users to a presigned URL for an S3 file, you can pass an `S3File` instance to a `Response` object as the body.

```ts
const response = new Response(s3file);
console.log(response);
```

This will automatically redirect the user to the presigned URL for the S3 file, saving you the memory, time, and bandwidth cost of downloading the file to your server and sending it back to the user.

```ts
Response (0 KB) {
  ok: false,
  url: "",
  status: 302,
  statusText: "",
  headers: Headers {
    "location": "https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/...",
  },
  redirected: true,
  bodyUsed: false
}
```

## Support for S3-Compatible Services

Bun's S3 implementation works with any S3-compatible storage service. Just specify the appropriate endpoint:

```ts
import { s3 } from "bun";

// CloudFlare R2
const r2file = s3("my-file.txt", {
  accessKeyId: "access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "secret-key",
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  endpoint: "https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com",
});

// DigitalOcean Spaces
const spacesFile = s3("my-file.txt", {
  accessKeyId: "access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "secret-key",
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  endpoint: "https://<region>.digitaloceanspaces.com",
});

// MinIO
const minioFile = s3("my-file.txt", {
  accessKeyId: "access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "secret-key",
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  endpoint: "http://localhost:9000",
});
```

## Credentials

Credentials are one of the hardest parts of using S3, and we've tried to make it as easy as possible. By default, Bun reads the following environment variables for credentials.

| Option name       | Environment variable   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| `accessKeyId`     | `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     |
| `secretAccessKey` | `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |
| `region`          | `S3_REGION`            |
| `endpoint`        | `S3_ENDPOINT`          |
| `bucket`          | `S3_BUCKET`            |
| `sessionToken`    | `S3_SESSION_TOKEN`     |

If the `S3_*` environment variable is not set, Bun will also check for the `AWS_*` environment variable, for each of the above options.

| Option name       | Fallback environment variable |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `accessKeyId`     | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`           |
| `secretAccessKey` | `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`       |
| `region`          | `AWS_REGION`                  |
| `endpoint`        | `AWS_ENDPOINT`                |
| `bucket`          | `AWS_BUCKET`                  |
| `sessionToken`    | `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`           |

These environment variables are read from [`.env` files](/docs/runtime/env) or from the process environment at initialization time (`process.env` is not used for this).

These defaults are overriden by the options you pass to `s3(credentials)`, `new Bun.S3(credentials)`, or any of the methods that accept credentials. So if, for example, you use the same credentials for different buckets, you can set the credentials once in your `.env` file and then pass `bucket: "my-bucket"` to the `s3()` helper function without having to specify all the credentials again.

### `S3` Buckets

Passing around all of these credentials can be cumbersome. To make it easier, you can create a `S3` bucket instance.

```ts
import { S3 } from "bun";

const bucket = new S3({
  accessKeyId: "your-access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "your-secret-key",
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  // sessionToken: "..."
  endpoint: "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
  // endpoint: "https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com", // Cloudflare R2
  // endpoint: "http://localhost:9000", // MinIO
});

// bucket is a function that creates `S3File` instances (lazy)
const file = bucket("my-file.txt");

// Write to S3
await file.write("Hello World!");

// Read from S3
const text = await file.text();

// Write using a Response
await file.write(new Response("Hello World!"));

// Presign a URL
const url = file.presign({
  expiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24, // 1 day
  acl: "public-read",
});

// Delete the file
await file.unlink();
```

#### Read a file from an `S3` bucket

The `S3` bucket instance is itself a function that creates `S3File` instances. It provides a more convenient API for interacting with S3.

```ts
const s3file = bucket("my-file.txt");
const text = await s3file.text();
const json = await s3file.json();
const bytes = await s3file.bytes();
const arrayBuffer = await s3file.arrayBuffer();
```

#### Write a file to S3

To write a file to the bucket, you can use the `write` method.

```ts
const bucket = new Bun.S3({
  accessKeyId: "your-access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "your-secret-key",
  endpoint: "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
  bucket: "my-bucket",
});
await bucket.write("my-file.txt", "Hello World!");
await bucket.write("my-file.txt", new Response("Hello World!"));
```

You can also call `.write` on the `S3File` instance created by the `S3` bucket instance.

```ts
const s3file = bucket("my-file.txt");
await s3file.write("Hello World!", {
  type: "text/plain",
});
await s3file.write(new Response("Hello World!"));
```

#### Delete a file from S3

To delete a file from the bucket, you can use the `delete` method.

```ts
const bucket = new Bun.S3({
  accessKeyId: "your-access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "your-secret-key",
  bucket: "my-bucket",
});

await bucket.delete("my-file.txt");
```

You can also use the `unlink` method, which is an alias for `delete`.

```ts
// "delete" and "unlink" are aliases of each other.
await bucket.unlink("my-file.txt");
```

## `S3File`

`S3File` instances are created by calling the `S3` instance method or the `s3()` helper function. Like `Bun.file()`, `S3File` instances are lazy. They don't refer to something that necessarily exists at the time of creation. That's why all the methods that don't involve network requests are fully synchronous.

```ts
interface S3File extends Blob {
  slice(start: number, end?: number): S3File;
  exists(): Promise<boolean>;
  unlink(): Promise<void>;
  presign(options: S3Options): string;
  text(): Promise<string>;
  json(): Promise<any>;
  bytes(): Promise<Uint8Array>;
  arrayBuffer(): Promise<ArrayBuffer>;
  stream(options: S3Options): ReadableStream;
  write(
    data:
      | string
      | Uint8Array
      | ArrayBuffer
      | Blob
      | ReadableStream
      | Response
      | Request,
    options?: BlobPropertyBag,
  ): Promise<void>;

  readonly size: Promise<number>;

  // ... more omitted for brevity
}
```

Like `Bun.file()`, `S3File` extends [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob), so all the methods that are available on `Blob` are also available on `S3File`. The same API for reading data from a local file is also available for reading data from S3.

| Method                       | Output           |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `await s3File.text()`        | `string`         |
| `await s3File.bytes()`       | `Uint8Array`     |
| `await s3File.json()`        | `JSON`           |
| `await s3File.stream()`      | `ReadableStream` |
| `await s3File.arrayBuffer()` | `ArrayBuffer`    |

That means using `S3File` instances with `fetch()`, `Response`, and other web APIs that accept `Blob` instances just works.

### Partial reads

To read a partial range of a file, you can use the `slice` method.

```ts
const partial = s3file.slice(0, 1024);

// Read the partial range as a Uint8Array
const bytes = await partial.bytes();

// Read the partial range as a string
const text = await partial.text();
```

Internally, this works by using the HTTP `Range` header to request only the bytes you want. This `slice` method is the same as [`Blob.prototype.slice`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob/slice).

## Error codes

When Bun's S3 API throws an error, it will have a `code` property that matches one of the following values:

- `ERR_S3_MISSING_CREDENTIALS`
- `ERR_S3_INVALID_METHOD`
- `ERR_S3_INVALID_PATH`
- `ERR_S3_INVALID_ENDPOINT`
- `ERR_S3_INVALID_SIGNATURE`
- `ERR_S3_INVALID_SESSION_TOKEN`

When the S3 Object Storage service returns an error (that is, not Bun), it will be an `S3Error` instance (an `Error` instance with the name `"S3Error"`).

## `S3` static methods

The `S3` class provides several static methods for interacting with S3.

### `S3.presign`

To generate a presigned URL for an S3 file, you can use the `S3.presign` method.

```ts
import { S3 } from "bun";

const url = S3.presign("my-file.txt", {
  accessKeyId: "your-access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "your-secret-key",
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  expiresIn: 3600,
  // endpoint: "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
  // endpoint: "https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com", // Cloudflare R2
});
```

This is the same as `S3File.prototype.presign` and `new S3(credentials).presign`, as a static method on the `S3` class.

### `S3.exists`

To check if an S3 file exists, you can use the `S3.exists` method.

```ts
import { S3 } from "bun";

const exists = await S3.exists("my-file.txt", {
  accessKeyId: "your-access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "your-secret-key",
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  // endpoint: "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
});
```

The same method also works on `S3File` instances.

```ts
const s3file = Bun.s3("my-file.txt", {
  accessKeyId: "your-access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "your-secret-key",
  bucket: "my-bucket",
});
const exists = await s3file.exists();
```

### `S3.size`

To get the size of an S3 file, you can use the `S3.size` method.

```ts
import { S3 } from "bun";
const size = await S3.size("my-file.txt", {
  accessKeyId: "your-access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "your-secret-key",
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  // endpoint: "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
});
```

### `S3.unlink`

To delete an S3 file, you can use the `S3.unlink` method.

```ts
import { S3 } from "bun";

await S3.unlink("my-file.txt", {
  accessKeyId: "your-access-key",
  secretAccessKey: "your-secret-key",
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  // endpoint: "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
});
```

## s3:// protocol

To make it easier to use the same code for local files and S3 files, the `s3://` protocol is supported in `fetch` and `Bun.file()`.

```ts
const response = await fetch("s3://my-bucket/my-file.txt");
const file = Bun.file("s3://my-bucket/my-file.txt");
```

This is the equivalent of calling `Bun.s3("my-file.txt", { bucket: "my-bucket" })`.

This `s3://` protocol exists to make it easier to use the same code for local files and S3 files.
