This command installs completions for `zsh` and/or `fish`. It runs automatically on every `bun upgrade` and on install. It reads from `$SHELL` to determine which shell to install for. It tries several common shell completion directories for your shell and OS.

If you want to copy the completions manually, run `bun completions > path-to-file`. If you know the completions directory to install them to, run `bun completions /path/to/directory`.
