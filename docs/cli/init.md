Scaffold an empty Bun project with the interactive `bun init` command.

```bash
$ bun init
bun init helps you get started with a minimal project and tries to
guess sensible defaults. Press ^C anytime to quit.

package name (quickstart):
entry point (index.ts):

Done! A package.json file was saved in the current directory.
 + index.ts
 + .gitignore
 + tsconfig.json (for editor auto-complete)
 + README.md

To get started, run:
  bun run index.ts
```

Press `enter` to accept the default answer for each prompt, or pass the `-y` flag to auto-accept the defaults.

{% details summary="How `bun init` works" %}

`bun init` is a quick way to start a blank project with Bun. It guesses with sane defaults and is non-destructive when run multiple times.

![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/183006613-271960a3-ff22-4f7c-83f5-5e18f684c836.gif)

It creates:

- a `package.json` file with a name that defaults to the current directory name
- a `tsconfig.json` file or a `jsconfig.json` file, depending if the entry point is a TypeScript file or not
- an entry point which defaults to `index.ts` unless any of `index.{tsx, jsx, js, mts, mjs}` exist or the `package.json` specifies a `module` or `main` field
- a `README.md` file

If you pass `-y` or `--yes`, it will assume you want to continue without asking questions.

At the end, it runs `bun install` to install `bun-types`.
