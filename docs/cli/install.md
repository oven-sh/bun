The `bun` CLI contains an `npm`-compatible package manager designed to be a faster replacement for existing package management tools like `npm`, `yarn`, and `pnpm`. It's designed for Node.js compatibility; use it in any Bun or Node.js project.

{% details summary="For Linux users" %}
The minimum Linux Kernel version is 5.1. If you're on Linux kernel 5.1 - 5.5, `bun install` should still work, but HTTP requests will be slow due to a lack of support for io_uring's `connect()` operation.

If you're using Ubuntu 20.04, here's how to install a [newer kernel](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack):

```bash
# If this returns a version >= 5.6, you don't need to do anything
uname -r

# Install the official Ubuntu hardware enablement kernel
sudo apt install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-20.04
```

## Install dependencies

To install all dependencies of a project:

```bash
$ bun install
```

On Linux, `bun install` tends to install packages 20-100x faster than `npm install`. On macOS, it's more like 4-80x.

![package install benchmark](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/147004342-571b6123-17a9-49a2-8bfd-dcfc5204047e.png)

Running `bun install` will:

- **Install** all `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `optionalDependencies`. Bun does not install `peerDependencies` by default.
- **Run** your project's `{pre|post}install` scripts at the appropriate time. For security reasons Bun _does not execute_ lifecycle scripts of installed dependencies.
- **Write** a `bun.lockb` lockfile to the project root.

To install in production mode (i.e. without `devDependencies`):

```bash
$ bun install --production
```

To perform a dry run (i.e. don't actually install anything):

```bash
$ bun install --dry-run
```

To modify logging verbosity:

```bash
$ bun install --verbose # debug logging
$ bun install --silent  # no logging
```

{% details summary="Configuring behavior" %}
The default behavior of `bun install` can be configured in `bun.toml`:

```toml
[install]

# whether to install optionalDependencies
optional = true

# whether to install devDependencies
dev = true

# whether to install peerDependencies
peer = false

# equivalent to `--production` flag
production = false

# equivalent to `--dry-run` flag
dryRun = false
```

{% /details %}

## Add and remove packages

To add or remove a particular package:

```bash
$ bun add preact
$ bun remove preact
```

To specify a version, version range, or tag:

```bash
$ bun add zod@3.20.0
$ bun add zod@^3.0.0
$ bun add zod@latest
```

To add a package as a dev dependency (`"devDependencies"`):

```bash
$ bun add --development @types/react
$ bun add -d @types/react
```

To add a package as an optional dependency (`"optionalDependencies"`):

```bash
$ bun add --optional lodash
```

To install a package globally:

```bash
$ bun add --global cowsay # or `bun add -g cowsay`
$ cowsay "Bun!"
 ______
< Bun! >
 ------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

{% details summary="Configuring global installation behavior" %}

```toml
[install]
# where `bun install --global` installs packages
globalDir = "~/.bun/install/global"

# where globally-installed package bins are linked
globalBinDir = "~/.bun/bin"
```

{% /details %}
To view a complete list of options for a given command:

```bash
$ bun add --help
```

## Git dependencies

To add a dependency from a git repository:

```bash
$ bun install git@github.com:moment/moment.git
```

Bun supports a variety of protocols, including [`github`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#github-urls), [`git`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#git-urls-as-dependencies), `git+ssh`, `git+https`, and many more.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "dayjs": "git+https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs.git",
    "lodash": "git+ssh://github.com/lodash/lodash.git#4.17.21",
    "moment": "git@github.com:moment/moment.git",
    "zod": "github:colinhacks/zod"
  }
}
```

## Global cache

All packages downloaded from the registry are stored in a global cache at `~/.bun/install/cache`. They are stored in subdirectories named like `${name}@${version}`, so multiple versions of a package can be cached.

{% details summary="Configuring cache behavior" %}

```toml
[install.cache]
# the directory to use for the cache
dir = "~/.bun/install/cache"

# when true, don't load from the global cache.
# Bun may still write to node_modules/.cache
disable = false

# when true, always resolve the latest versions from the registry
disableManifest = false
```

{% /details %}

### Minimizing re-downloads

Bun strives to avoid re-downloading packages mutiple times. When installing a package, if the cache already contains a version in the range specified by `package.json`, Bun will use the cached package instead of downloading it again.

{% details summary="Installation details" %}
If the semver version has pre-release suffix (`1.0.0-beta.0`) or a build suffix (`1.0.0+20220101`), it is replaced with a hash of that value instead, to reduce the chances of errors associated with long file paths.

When the `node_modules` folder exists, before installing, Bun checks that `node_modules` contains all expected packages with appropriate versions. If so `bun install` completes. Bun uses a custom JSON parser which stops parsing as soon as it finds `"name"` and `"version"`.

If a package is missing or has a version incompatible with the `package.json`, Bun checks for a compatible module in the cache. If found, it is installed into `node_modules`. Otherwise, the package will be downloaded from the registry then installed.
{% /details %}

### Fast copying

Once a package is downloaded into the cache, Bun still needs to copy those files into `node_modules`. Bun uses the fastest syscalls available to perform this task. On Linux, it uses hardlinks; on macOS, it uses `clonefile`.

### Saving disk space

Since Bun uses hardlinks to "copy" a module into a project's `node_modules` directory on Linux, the contents of the package only exist in a single location on disk, greatly reducing the amount of disk space dedicated to `node_modules`.

This benefit does not extend to macOS, which uses `clonefile` for performance reasons.

{% details summary="Installation strategies" %}
This behavior is configurable with the `--backend` flag, which is respected by all of Bun's package management commands.

- **`hardlink`**: Default on Linux.
- **`clonefile`** Default on macOS.
- **`clonefile_each_dir`**: Similar to `clonefile`, except it clones each file individually per directory. It is only available on macOS and tends to perform slower than `clonefile`.
- **`copyfile`**: The fallback used when any of the above fail. It is the slowest option. On macOS, it uses `fcopyfile()`; on Linux it uses `copy_file_range()`.
  **`symlink`**: Currently used only `file:` (and eventually `link:`) dependencies. To prevent infinite loops, it skips symlinking the `node_modules` folder.

If you install with `--backend=symlink`, Node.js won't resolve node_modules of dependencies unless each dependency has its own `node_modules` folder or you pass `--preserve-symlinks` to `node`. See [Node.js documentation on `--preserve-symlinks`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--preserve-symlinks).

```bash
$ bun install --backend symlink
$ node --preserve-symlinks ./foo.js
```

Bun's runtime does not currently expose an equivalent of `--preserve-symlinks`.
{% /details %}

## Lockfile

Running `bun install` will create a binary lockfile called `bun.lockb`.

#### Why is it binary?

In a word: Performance. Bun’s lockfile saves & loads incredibly quickly, and saves a lot more data than what is typically inside lockfiles.

#### How do I inspect it?

Run `bun install -y` to generate a Yarn-compatible `yarn.lock` (v1) that can be inspected more easily.

#### Platform-specific dependencies?

Bun stores normalized `cpu` and `os` values from npm in the lockfile, along with the resolved packages. It skips downloading, extracting, and installing packages disabled for the current target at runtime. This means the lockfile won’t change between platforms/architectures even if the packages ultimately installed do change.

#### What does the lockfile store?

Packages, metadata for those packages, the hoisted install order, dependencies for each package, what packages those dependencies resolved to, an integrity hash (if available), what each package was resolved to, and which version (or equivalent).

#### Why is it fast?

It uses linear arrays for all data. [Packages](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/be03fc273a487ac402f19ad897778d74b6d72963/src/install/install.zig#L1825) are referenced by an auto-incrementing integer ID or a hash of the package name. Strings longer than 8 characters are de-duplicated. Prior to saving on disk, the lockfile is garbage-collected & made deterministic by walking the package tree and cloning the packages in dependency order.

#### Can I opt out?

To install without creating a lockfile:

```bash
$ bun install --no-save
```

To install a Yarn lockfile _in addition_ to `bun.lockb`.

{% codetabs %}

```bash#CLI flag
$ bun install --yarn
```

```toml#bunfig.toml
[install.lockfile]
# whether to save a non-Bun lockfile alongside bun.lockb
# only "yarn" is supported
print = "yarn"
```

{% /codetabs %}

{% details summary="Configuring lockfile" %}

```toml
[install.lockfile]

# path to read bun.lockb from
path = "bun.lockb"

# path to save bun.lockb to
savePath = "bun.lockb"

# whether to save the lockfile to disk
save = true

# whether to save a non-Bun lockfile alongside bun.lockb
# only "yarn" is supported
print = "yarn"
```

{% /details %}

## Workspaces

Bun supports [`workspaces`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/workspaces?v=true#description) in `package.json`. Workspaces make it easy to develop complex software as a _monorepo_ consisting of several independent packages.

To try it, specify a list of sub-packages in the `workspaces` field of your `package.json`; it's conventional to place these sub-packages in a directory called `packages`.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"]
}
```

{% callout %}
**Glob support** — Bun v0.5.8 added support for simple globs for workspace names, with a "*/" at the end. Nothing too fancy.
{% /callout %}

This has a couple major benefits.

- **Code can be split into logical parts.** If one package relies on another, you can simply add it as a dependency with `bun add`. If package `b` depends on `a`, `bun install` will symlink your local `packages/a` directory into the `node_modules` folder of `b`, instead of trying to download it from the npm registry.
- **Dependencies can be de-duplicated.** If `a` and `b` share a common dependency, it will be _hoisted_ to the root `node_modules` directory. This reduces redundant disk usage and minimizes "dependency hell" issues associated with having multiple versions of a package installed simultaneously.

{% callout %}
⚡️ **Speed** — Installs are fast, even for big monorepos. Bun installs the [Remix](https://github.com/remix-run/remix) monorepo in about `500ms` on Linux.

- 28x faster than `npm install`
- 12x faster than `yarn install` (v1)
- 8x faster than `pnpm install`

{% image src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/212829600-77df9544-7c9f-4d8d-a984-b2cd0fd2aa52.png" /%}
{% /callout %}

## Registries

The default registry is `registry.npmjs.org`. This can be globally configured in `bunfig.toml`:

```toml
[install]
# set default registry as a string
registry = "https://registry.npmjs.org"
# set a token
registry = { url = "https://registry.npmjs.org", token = "123456" }
# set a username/password
registry = "https://username:password@registry.npmjs.org"
```

To configure a private registry scoped to a particular organization:

```toml
[install.scopes]
# registry as string
"@myorg1" = "https://username:password@registry.myorg.com/"

# registry with username/password
# you can reference environment variables
"@myorg2" = { username = "myusername", password = "$NPM_PASS", url = "https://registry.myorg.com/" }

# registry with token
"@myorg3" = { token = "$npm_token", url = "https://registry.myorg.com/" }
```

## Linking and unlinking

Use `bun link` in a local directory to register the current package as a "linkable" package.

```bash
$ cd /path/to/cool-pkg
$ cat package.json
{
  "name": "cool-pkg",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
$ bun link
bun link v0.5.7 (7416672e)
Success! Registered "cool-pkg"

To use cool-pkg in a project, run:
  bun link cool-pkg

Or add it in dependencies in your package.json file:
  "cool-pkg": "link:cool-pkg"
```

This package can now be "linked" into other projects using `bun link cool-pkg`. This will create a symlink in the `node_modules` directory of the target project, pointing to the local directory.

```bash
$ cd /path/to/my-app
$ bun link cool-pkg
```

This will add `cool-pkg` to the `dependencies` field of your app's package.json with a special version specifier that tells Bun to load from the registered local directory instead of installing from `npm`.

```json-diff
  {
    "name": "my-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "dependencies": {
+     "cool-pkg": "link:cool-pkg"
    }
  }
```

## Utilities

The `bun pm` command group provides a set of utilities for working with Bun's package manager.

To print the path to the `bin` directory for the local project:

```bash
$ bun pm bin
/path/to/current/project/node_modules/.bin
```

To get the path to the global `bin` directory:

```bash
$ bun pm bin
<$HOME>/.bun/bin
```

To print a list of packages installed in the current project and their resolved versions, excluding their dependencies. Use the `--all` flag to print the entire tree, including all nth-order dependencies.

```bash
/path/to/project node_modules (5)
├── eslint@8.33.0
├── react@18.2.0
├── react-dom@18.2.0
├── typescript@4.8.4
└── zod@3.20.1
```

To print the path to Bun's global module cache:

```bash
$ bun pm cache
```

To clear Bun's global module cache:

```bash
$ bun pm cache rm
```
