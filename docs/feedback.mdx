## Reporting Issues

<Steps>
	<Step title="Upgrade Bun">
		Try upgrading Bun to the latest version with `bun upgrade`. This might fix your problem without having to open an issue.

    	```bash terminal icon="terminal"
    	bun upgrade
    	```

    	You can also try the latest canary release, which includes the most recent changes and bug fixes that haven't been released in a stable version yet.

    	```bash terminal icon="terminal"
    	bun upgrade --canary

    	# To revert back to the stable
    	bun upgrade --stable
    	```

    	If the issue still persists after upgrading, continue to the next step.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Review Existing Issues">
    	First take a minute to check if the issue has already been reported. Don't open a new issue if it has already been reported, it saves time for everyone and helps us focus on fixing things faster.

    	- üîç [**Search existing issues**](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues)
    	- üí¨ [**Check discussions**](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/discussions)

    	If you find a related issue, add a üëç reaction or comment with extra details instead of opening a new one.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Report the Issue">
    	If no one has reported the issue, please open a new issue or suggest an improvement.

    	- üêû [**Report a Bug**](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/new?template=2-bug-report.yml)
    	- ‚ö° [**Suggest an Improvement**](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/new?template=4-feature-request.yml)

    	Please provide as much detail as possible, including:
    	- A clear and concise title
    	- A code example or steps to reproduce the issue
    	- The version of Bun you are using (run `bun --version`)
    	- A detailed description of the issue (what happened, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened)
    	- The operating system and version you are using
    		<Note>
    			- For MacOS and Linux: copy the output of `uname -mprs`
    		  - For Windows: copy the output of this command in the powershell console:
    				```powershell
    					"$([Environment]::OSVersion | ForEach-Object VersionString) $(if ([Environment]::Is64BitOperatingSystem) { "x64" } else { "x86" })"
    				```
    		</Note>
    </Step>

</Steps>

The Bun team will review the issue and get back to you as soon as possible!

## Use `bun feedback`

Alternatively, you can use `bun feedback` to share feedback, bug reports, and feature requests directly with the Bun team.

```bash terminal icon="terminal"
bun feedback "Love the new release!"
bun feedback report.txt details.log
echo "please document X" | bun feedback --email you@example.com
```

You can provide feedback as text arguments, file paths, or piped input.
