The [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) class provides a number of methods for consuming its contents in different formats. This snippets reads the contents to an `ArrayBuffer`, then creates a `Uint8Array` from the buffer.

```ts
const blob = new Blob(["hello world"]);
const arr = new Uint8Array(await blob.arrayBuffer());
```
