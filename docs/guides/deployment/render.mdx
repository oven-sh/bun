[Render](https://render.com/) is a cloud platform that lets you flexibly build, deploy, and scale your apps.

It offers features like auto deploys from GitHub, a global CDN, private networks, automatic HTTPS setup, and managed PostgreSQL and Redis.

Render supports Bun natively. You can deploy Bun apps as web services, background workers, cron jobs, and more.

As an example, let's deploy a simple Express HTTP server to Render.

<Steps>
	<Step title="Step 1">
		Create a new GitHub repo named `myapp`. Git clone it locally.

    	```sh
    	git clone git@github.com:my-github-username/myapp.git
    	cd myapp
    	```
    	</Step>
    	<Step title="Step 2">
    	Add the Express library.

    	```sh
    	bun add express
    	```

    </Step>

    <Step title="Step 3">
    	Define a simple server with Express:

    	```ts app.ts icon="/icons/typescript.svg"
    	import express from "express";

    	const app = express();
    	const port = process.env.PORT || 3001;

    	app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    		res.send("Hello World!");
    	});

    	app.listen(port, () => {
    		console.log(`Listening on port ${port}...`);
    	});
    	```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Step 4">

    	Commit your changes and push to GitHub.

    	```sh terminal icon="terminal"
    	git add app.ts bun.lock package.json
    	git commit -m "Create simple Express app"
    	git push origin main
    	```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Step 5">
    	In your [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/), click `New` > `Web Service` and connect your `myapp` repo.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Step 6">
    	In the Render UI, provide the following values during web service creation:

    	|                   |               |
    	| ----------------- | ------------- |
    	| **Runtime**       | `Node`        |
    	| **Build Command** | `bun install` |
    	| **Start Command** | `bun app.ts`  |

    </Step>

</Steps>

That's it! Your web service will be live at its assigned `onrender.com` URL as soon as the build finishes.
