Start the dev server with `bunx`.

By default, Bun will run the dev server with Node.js. To use the Bun runtime instead, use the `--bun` flag.

```sh
$ bunx --bun astro dev
  ðŸš€  astro  v3.1.4 started in 200ms

  â”ƒ Local    http://localhost:4321/
  â”ƒ Network  use --host to expose
```

---

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) with your browser to see the result. Astro will hot-reload your app as you edit your source files.
