Start the dev server with `bunx`.

By default, Bun will run the dev server with Node.js. To use the Bun runtime instead, use the `--bun` flag.

```sh
$ bunx --bun astro dev
  ðŸš€  astro  v2.10.5 started in 200ms

  â”ƒ Local    http://localhost:3000/
  â”ƒ Network  use --host to expose

01:48:34 PM [content] Types generated
01:48:34 PM [astro] update /.astro/types.d.ts
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. Astro will hot-reload your app as you edit your source files.
