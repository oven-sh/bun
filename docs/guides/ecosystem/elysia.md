name: Build an HTTP server using Elysia and Bun
---

[Elysia](https://elysiajs.com) is a Bun-first performance focused web framework that takes full advantage of Bun's HTTP, file system, and hot reloading APIs. Get started with `bun create`.

```bash
$ bun create elysia myapp
$ cd myapp
$ bun run dev
```

---

To define a simple HTTP route and start a server with Elysia:

```ts#server.ts
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const app = new Elysia()
	.get('/', () => 'Hello Elysia')
	.listen(8080)

console.log(`ðŸ¦Š Elysia is running at on port ${app.server?.port}...`)
```

---

Elysia is a full-featured server framework with Express-like syntax, type inference, middleware, file uploads, and plugins for JWT authentication, tRPC, and more. It's also is one of the [fastest Bun web frameworks](https://github.com/SaltyAom/bun-http-framework-benchmark).

Refer to the Elysia [documentation](https://elysiajs.com/quick-start.html) for more information.
