Gel is a next-generation graph-relational database designed as a spiritual successor to the relational database.

It inherits the strengths of SQL databases: type safety, performance, reliability, and transactionality. But instead of modeling data in a relational (tabular) way, Gel represents data with object types containing properties and links to other objects. It leverages this object-oriented model to provide a superpowered query language that solves some of SQL's biggest usability problems.

First, [install Gel](https://www.geldata.com/) if you haven't already.

                                         /$$$$
                                        /$$$$$$
                                       | $$$$$$
         /$$$$$$$$        /$$$$$$$     | $$$$$$
       /$$$$$$$$$$$$    /$$$$$$$$$$$   | $$$$$$
      /$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  /$$$$$$$$$$$$$  | $$$$$$
                                         /$$$$
                                        /$$$$$$
                                       | $$$$$$
         /$$$$$$$$        /$$$$$$$     | $$$$$$
       /$$$$$$$$$$$$    /$$$$$$$$$$$   | $$$$$$
      /$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  /$$$$$$$$$$$$$  | $$$$$$

Use `bun init` to create a fresh project.

```sh
$ mkdir my-gel-db
$ cd my-gel-db
$ bun init -y
```

---

We'll use the Gel CLI to initialize a Gel DataBase instance for our project. This creates an `gel.toml` file in our project root.

```sh
$ bunx gel project init
No `gel.toml` found in `/home/username/bun-app/my-gel-db` or above

After all these manipulations, you should already have in your arsenal `gel` command, if not, then go back to [install Gel](https://www.geldata.com/)

```sh
$ gel
                     ▄██▄
   ▄▄▄▄▄      ▄▄▄    ████

Gel x.y+01d987d (repl x.y.0+70c7e2d)
Type \help for help, \quit to quit.

```

Now you have a dbschema to work with in the future. On the [Gel Docs](https://docs.geldata.com/) website you can study very convenient documentation written by the Gel authors.
