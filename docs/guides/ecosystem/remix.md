name: Build an app with Remix and Bun
---

{% callout %}
Currently the Remix development server (`remix dev`) relies on Node.js APIs that Bun does not yet implement. The guide below uses Bun to initialize a project and install dependencies, but it uses Node.js to run the dev server.
{% /callout %}

Initialize a Remix app with `create-remix`.

```sh
$ bun create remix

 remix   v1.19.3 ðŸ’¿ Let's build a better website...

   dir   Where should we create your new project?
         ./my-app

      â—¼  Using basic template See https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/templates#templates for more
      âœ”  Template copied

   git   Initialize a new git repository?
         Yes

  deps   Install dependencies with bun?
         Yes

      âœ”  Dependencies installed

      âœ”  Git initialized

  done   That's it!

         Enter your project directory using cd ./my-app
         Check out README.md for development and deploy instructions.
```

---

To start the dev server, run `bun run dev` from the project root. This will start the dev server using the `remix dev` command. Note that Node.js will be used to run the dev server.

```sh
$ cd my-app
$ bun run dev
  $ remix dev

  ðŸ’¿  remix dev

  info  building...
  info  built (263ms)
  Remix App Server started at http://localhost:3000 (http://172.20.0.143:3000)
```

---

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app. Any changes you make to `app/routes/_index.tsx` will be hot-reloaded in the browser.

---

To build and start your app, run `bun run build` then `bun run start` from the project root.

```sh
$ bun run build
 $ remix build
 info  building... (NODE_ENV=production)
 info  built (158ms)
$ bun start
 $ remix-serve ./build/index.js
 [remix-serve] http://localhost:3000 (http://192.168.86.237:3000)
```
