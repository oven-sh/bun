name: Deploy a Bun application on Render
---

[Render](https://render.com/) is a cloud platform that lets you flexibly build, deploy, and scale your apps.

It offers features like auto deploys from GitHub, a global CDN, private networks, automatic HTTPS setup, and managed PostgreSQL and Redis.

Render supports Bun natively. You can deploy Bun apps as web services, background workers, cron jobs, and more.

---

As an example, let's deploy a simple Express HTTP server to Render.

---

Create a new GitHub repo named `myapp`. Git clone it locally.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:my-github-username/myapp.git
cd myapp
```

---

Add the Express library.

```bash
bun add express
```

---

Define a simple server with Express:

```ts#app.ts
import express from "express";

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3001;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}...`);
});
```

---

Commit your changes and push to GitHub.

```bash
git add app.ts bun.lockb package.json
git commit -m "Create simple Express app"
git push origin main
```

---

In your [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/), click `New` > `Web Service` and connect your `myapp` repo.

---

In the Render UI, provide the following values during web service creation:

|                   |               |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| **Runtime**       | `Node`        |
| **Build Command** | `bun install` |
| **Start Command** | `bun app.js`  |

---

That's it! Your web service will be live at its assigned `onrender.com` URL as soon as the build finishes.

You can view the [deploy logs](https://docs.render.com/logging#logs-for-an-individual-deploy-or-job) for details. Refer to [Render's documentation](https://docs.render.com/deploys) for a complete overview of deploying on Render.
