[StricJS](https://github.com/bunsvr) is a Bun framework for building high-performance web applications and APIs.

- **Fast** — Stric is one of the fastest Bun frameworks. See [benchmark](https://github.com/bunsvr/benchmark) for more details.
- **Minimal** — The basic components like `@stricjs/router` and `@stricjs/utils` are under 50kB and require no external dependencies.
- **Extensible** — Stric includes with a plugin system, dependency injection, and optional optimizations for handling requests.

---

Use `bun init` to create an empty project.

```bash terminal icon="terminal"
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
bun init
bun add @stricjs/router @stricjs/utils
```

---

To implement a simple HTTP server with StricJS:

```ts index.ts icon="file-code"
import { Router } from "@stricjs/router";

export default new Router().get("/", () => new Response("Hi"));
```

---

To serve static files from `/public`:

```ts index.ts icon="file-code"
import { dir } from "@stricjs/utils";

export default new Router().get("/", () => new Response("Hi")).get("/*", dir("./public"));
```

---

Run the file in watch mode to start the development server.

```bash terminal icon="terminal"
bun --watch run index.ts
```
