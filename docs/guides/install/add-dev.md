name: Add a development dependency
---

To add an npm package as a development dependency, use `bun add --development`.

```sh
$ bun add zod --dev
$ bun add zod -d # shorthand
```

---

This will add the package to `devDependencies` in `package.json`.

```json-diff
{
  "devDependencies": {
+   "zod": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```

See [Docs > Package manager](/docs/cli/install) for complete documentation of Bun's package manager.
