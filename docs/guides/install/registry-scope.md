name: Configure a private registry for an organization scope with bun install
---

Bun does not read `.npmrc` files; instead private registries are configured via `bunfig.toml`. To configure a registry for a particular npm scope:

```toml#bunfig.toml
[install.scopes]
# as a string
"@myorg1" = "https://username:password@registry.myorg.com/"

# as an object with username/password
# you can reference environment variables
"@myorg2" = {
  username = "myusername",
  password = "$npm_pass",
  url = "https://registry.myorg.com/"
}

# as an object with token
"@myorg3" = { token = "$npm_token", url = "https://registry.myorg.com/" }

```

---

Your `bunfig.toml` can reference environment variables. Bun automatically loads environment variables from `.env.local`, `.env.[NODE_ENV]`, and `.env`. See [Docs > Environment variables](/docs/runtime/env) for more information.

```toml#bunfig.toml
[install.scopes]
"@myorg3" = { token = "$npm_token", url = "https://registry.myorg.com/" }
```

See [Docs > Package manager](/docs/cli/install) for complete documentation of Bun's package manager.
