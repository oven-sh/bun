Private registries can be configured using either [`.npmrc`](/pm/npmrc) or [`bunfig.toml`](/runtime/bunfig#install-registry). While both are supported, we recommend using **bunfig.toml** for enhanced flexibility and Bun-specific options.

To configure a registry for a particular npm scope:

<Note>
  Scope names are specified **without the `@` prefix**. For example, to configure a registry for packages like `@myorg/package`, use `myorg` as the scope name. While you can also use `"@myorg"` (with quotes and `@`), the recommended syntax is without the `@`.
</Note>


```toml bunfig.toml icon="settings"
[install.scopes]
# Scope names are specified WITHOUT the @ prefix
# For packages like @myorg1/package, use "myorg1" as the scope name
myorg1 = "https://username:password@registry.myorg.com/"

# as an object with username/password
# you can reference environment variables
myorg2 = {
  username = "myusername",
  password = "$npm_pass",
  url = "https://registry.myorg.com/"
}

# as an object with token
myorg3 = { token = "$npm_token", url = "https://registry.myorg.com/" }

```

Your `bunfig.toml` can reference environment variables. Bun automatically loads environment variables from `.env.local`, `.env.[NODE_ENV]`, and `.env`. See [Docs > Environment variables](/runtime/environment-variables) for more information.

```toml bunfig.toml icon="settings"
[install.scopes]
myorg3 = { token = "$npm_token", url = "https://registry.myorg.com/" }
```
