name: Generate a human-readable lockfile
---

By default Bun generates a binary `bun.lockb` file when you run `bun install`. In some cases, it's preferable to generate a human-readable lockfile instead.

---

Use the `--yarn` flag to generate a Yarn-compatible `yarn.lock` file (in addition to `bun.lockb`).

```sh
$ bun install --yarn
```

---

To set this as the default behavior, add the following to your `bunfig.toml` file.

```toml#bunfig.toml
[install.lockfile]
print = "yarn"
```

---

To print a Yarn lockfile to your console without writing it to disk, just "run" your `bun.lockb` with `bun`.

```sh
$ bun bun.lockb
# THIS IS AN AUTOGENERATED FILE. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
# yarn lockfile v1
# bun ./bun.lockb --hash: 9BFBF11D86084AAB-9418b03ff880c569-390CE6459EACEC9A...
