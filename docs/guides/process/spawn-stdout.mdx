When using [`Bun.spawn()`](/runtime/child-process), the `stdout` of the child process can be consumed as a `ReadableStream` via `proc.stdout`.

```ts
const proc = Bun.spawn(["echo", "hello"]);

const output = await proc.stdout.text();
output; // => "hello"
```

---

To instead pipe the `stdout` of the child process to `stdout` of the parent process, set "inherit".

```ts
const proc = Bun.spawn(["echo", "hello"], {
  stdout: "inherit",
});
```
