To import a `.html` file in Bun as a text file, use the `type: "text"` attribute in the import statement.

```ts file.ts icon="/icons/typescript.svg"
import html from "./file.html" with { type: "text" };

console.log(html); // <!DOCTYPE html><html><head>...
```

This can also be used with hot module reloading and/or watch mode to force Bun to reload whenever the `./file.html` file changes.
