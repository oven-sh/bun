The current environment variables can be accessed via `process.env`.

```ts index.ts icon="/icons/typescript.svg"
process.env.API_TOKEN; // => "secret"
```

---

Bun also exposes these variables via `Bun.env`, which is a simple alias of `process.env`.

```ts index.ts icon="/icons/typescript.svg"
Bun.env.API_TOKEN; // => "secret"
```

---

To print all currently-set environment variables to the command line, run `bun --print process.env`. This is useful for debugging.

```sh terminal icon="terminal"
bun --print process.env
```

```txt
BAZ=stuff
FOOBAR=aaaaaa
<lots more lines>
```

See [Docs > Runtime > Environment variables](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/env) for more information on using environment variables with Bun.
