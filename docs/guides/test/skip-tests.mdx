To skip a test with the Bun test runner, use the `test.skip` function.

```ts test.ts icon="/icons/typescript.svg"
import { test } from "bun:test";

test.skip("unimplemented feature", () => {
  expect(Bun.isAwesome()).toBe(true);
});
```

---

Running `bun test` will not execute this test. It will be marked as skipped in the terminal output.

```sh terminal icon="terminal"
bun test
```

```txt
test.test.ts:
✓ add [0.03ms]
✓ multiply [0.02ms]
» unimplemented feature

 2 pass
 1 skip

Ran 3 tests across 1 files. [74.00ms]
```
