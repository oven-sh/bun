Bun's test runner supports Jest-style snapshot testing via `.toMatchSnapshot()`.

```ts snap.test.ts icon="/icons/typescript.svg"
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("snapshot", () => {
  expect({ foo: "bar" }).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

---

The first time this test is executed, Bun will write a snapshot file to disk in a directory called `__snapshots__` that lives alongside the test file.

```txt File Tree icon="folder-tree"
test
├── __snapshots__
│   └── snap.test.ts.snap
└── snap.test.ts
```

---

To regenerate snapshots, use the `--update-snapshots` flag.

```sh terminal icon="terminal"
bun test --update-snapshots
```

```txt
test/snap.test.ts:
✓ snapshot [0.86ms]

 1 pass
 0 fail
 snapshots: +1 added # the snapshot was regenerated
 1 expect() calls
Ran 1 tests across 1 files. [102.00ms]
```
