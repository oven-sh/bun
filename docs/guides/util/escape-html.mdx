The `Bun.escapeHTML()` utility can be used to escape HTML characters in a string. The following replacements are made.

- `"` becomes `"&quot;"`
- `&` becomes `"&amp;"`
- `'` becomes `"&#x27;"`
- `<` becomes `"&lt;"`
- `>` becomes `"&gt;"`

This function is optimized for large input. Non-string types will be converted to a string before escaping.

```ts
Bun.escapeHTML("<script>alert('Hello World!')</script>");
// &lt;script&gt;alert(&#x27;Hello World!&#x27;)&lt;&#x2F;script&gt;
```
