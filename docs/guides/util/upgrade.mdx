Bun can upgrade itself using the built-in `bun upgrade` command. This is the fastest way to get the latest features and bug fixes.

```bash terminal icon="terminal"
bun upgrade
```

This downloads and installs the latest stable version of Bun, replacing the currently installed version.

<Note>To see the current version of Bun, run `bun --version`.</Note>

---

## Verify the upgrade

After upgrading, verify the new version:

```bash terminal icon="terminal"
bun --version
# Output: 1.x.y

# See the exact commit of the Bun binary
bun --revision
# Output: 1.x.y+abc123def
```

## Upgrade to canary builds

Canary builds are automatically released on every commit to the `main` branch. These are untested but useful for trying new features or verifying bug fixes before they're released.

```bash terminal icon="terminal"
bun upgrade --canary
```

<Warning>Canary builds are not recommended for production use. They may contain bugs or breaking changes.</Warning>

---

## Switch back to stable

If you're on a canary build and want to return to the latest stable release:

```bash terminal icon="terminal"
bun upgrade --stable
```

---

## Install a specific version

To install a specific version of Bun, use the install script with a version tag:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS & Linux">
    ```bash terminal icon="terminal"
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash -s "bun-v1.3.3"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell PowerShell icon="windows"
    iex "& {$(irm https://bun.sh/install.ps1)} -Version 1.3.3"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Package manager users

If you installed Bun via a package manager, use that package manager to upgrade instead of `bun upgrade` to avoid conflicts.

<Tip>
**Homebrew users** <br />
To avoid conflicts with Homebrew, use `brew upgrade bun` instead.

**Scoop users** <br />
To avoid conflicts with Scoop, use `scoop update bun` instead.

</Tip>
