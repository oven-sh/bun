This code snippet copies a file to another location on disk.

It uses the fast [`Bun.write()`](https://bun.com/docs/api/file-io#writing-files-bun-write) API to efficiently write data to disk. The first argument is a _destination_, like an absolute path or `BunFile` instance. The second argument is the _data_ to write.

```ts
const file = Bun.file("/path/to/original.txt");
await Bun.write("/path/to/copy.txt", file);
```
