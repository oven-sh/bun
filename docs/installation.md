Bun ships as a single executable that can be installed a few different ways.

## Installing

### macOS and Linux

{% callout %}
**Linux users** — The `unzip` package is required to install Bun. Use `sudo apt install unzip` to install `unzip` package.
Kernel version 5.6 or higher is strongly recommended, but the minimum is 5.1. Use `uname -r` to check Kernel version.
{% /callout %}

{% codetabs %}

```bash#macOS/Linux_(curl)
$ curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash # for macOS, Linux, and WSL
# to install a specific version
$ curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash -s "bun-v1.0.0"
```

```bash#npm
$ npm install -g bun # the last `npm` command you'll ever need
```

```bash#Homebrew
$ brew tap oven-sh/bun # for macOS and Linux
$ brew install bun
```

```bash#Docker
$ docker pull oven/bun
$ docker run --rm --init --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 oven/bun
```

```bash#Proto
$ proto install bun
```

{% /codetabs %}

### Windows

Bun provides a _limited, experimental_ native build for Windows. It is recommended to use Bun within [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and follow the above instructions. To help catch bugs, the experimental build enables many debugging assertions, which will make the binary slower than what the stable version will be.

To install, paste this into your terminal (Powershell or `cmd.exe`):

```powershell
# WARNING: No stability is guaranteed on the experimental Windows builds
powershell -c "iwr bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

For support and discussion, please join the [#windows channel on our Discord](http://bun.sh/discord).

## Docker

Bun provides a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/oven/bun/tags) that supports both Linux x64 and arm64.

```bash
$ docker pull oven/bun
$ docker run --rm --init --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 oven/bun
```

There are also image variants for different operating systems.

```bash
$ docker pull oven/bun:debian
$ docker pull oven/bun:slim
$ docker pull oven/bun:alpine
$ docker pull oven/bun:distroless
```

## Checking installation

To check that Bun was installed successfully, open a new terminal window and run `bun --version`.

```sh
$ bun --version
1.x.y
```

To see the precise commit of [oven-sh/bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) that you're using, run `bun --revision`.

```sh
$ bun --revision
1.x.y+b7982ac13189
```

If you've installed Bun but are seeing a `command not found` error, you may have to manually add the installation directory (`~/.bun/bin`) to your `PATH`.

{% details summary="How to add to your `PATH`" %}
First, determine what shell you're using:

```sh
$ echo $SHELL
/bin/zsh # or /bin/bash or /bin/fish
```

Then add these lines below to bottom of your shell's configuration file.

{% codetabs %}

```bash#~/.zshrc
# add to ~/.zshrc
export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"
export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
```

```bash#~/.bashrc
# add to ~/.bashrc
export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"
export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
```

```sh#~/.config/fish/config.fish
# add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
export BUN_INSTALL="$HOME/.bun"
export PATH="$BUN_INSTALL/bin:$PATH"
```

{% /codetabs %}
Save the file. You'll need to open a new shell/terminal window for the changes to take effect.

{% /details %}

## Upgrading

Once installed, the binary can upgrade itself.

```sh
$ bun upgrade
```

{% callout %}
**Homebrew users** — To avoid conflicts with Homebrew, use `brew upgrade bun` instead.

**proto users** - Use `proto install bun --pin` instead.
{% /callout %}

Bun automatically releases an (untested) canary build on every commit to `main`. To upgrade to the latest canary build:

```sh
$ bun upgrade --canary
```

[View canary build](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/releases/tag/canary)

{% callout %}
**Note** — To switch back to a stable release from canary, run `bun upgrade` again with no flags.
{% /callout %}

<!--
## Native

Works on macOS x64 & Silicon, Linux x64, Windows Subsystem for Linux.

```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Once installed, the binary can upgrade itself.

```sh
$ bun upgrade
```

Bun automatically releases an (untested) canary build on every commit to `main`. To upgrade to the latest canary build:

```sh
$ bun upgrade --canary
```

## Homebrew

Works on macOS and Linux

```sh
$ brew tap oven-sh/bun
$ brew install bun
```

Homebrew recommends using `brew upgrade <package>` to install newer versions.

## Docker

Works on Linux x64

```sh
# this is a comment
$ docker pull oven/bun:edge
this is some output
$ docker run --rm --init --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 oven/bun:edge
$ docker run --rm --init --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 oven/bun:edge
this is some output
``` -->

<!-- ## Completions

Shell auto-completion should be configured automatically when Bun is installed!

If not, run the following command. It uses `$SHELL` to determine which shell you're using and writes a completion file to the appropriate place on disk. It's automatically re-run on every `bun upgrade`.

```bash
$ bun completions
```

To write the completions to a custom location:

```bash
$ bun completions > path-to-file      # write to file
$ bun completions /path/to/directory  # write into directory
``` -->

## Uninstall

If you need to remove Bun from your system, use the following commands.

{% codetabs %}

```bash#macOS/Linux_(curl)
$ rm -rf ~/.bun # for macOS, Linux, and WSL
```

```bash#NPM
$ npm uninstall -g bun
```

```bash#Homebrew
$ brew uninstall bun
```

```bash#Proto
$ proto uninstall bun
```
