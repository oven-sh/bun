import Link from "/snippets/cli/link.mdx";

Use `bun link` in a local directory to register the current package as a "linkable" package.

```bash terminal icon="terminal"
cd /path/to/cool-pkg
cat package.json
bun link
```

```txt
bun link v1.x (7416672e)
Success! Registered "cool-pkg"

To use cool-pkg in a project, run:
  bun link cool-pkg

Or add it in dependencies in your package.json file:
  "cool-pkg": "link:cool-pkg"
```

This package can now be "linked" into other projects using `bun link cool-pkg`. This will create a symlink in the `node_modules` directory of the target project, pointing to the local directory.

```bash terminal icon="terminal"
cd /path/to/my-app
bun link cool-pkg
```

In addition, the `--save` flag can be used to add `cool-pkg` to the `dependencies` field of your app's package.json with a special version specifier that tells Bun to load from the registered local directory instead of installing from `npm`:

```json package.json icon="file-json"
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "cool-pkg": "link:cool-pkg" // [!code ++]
  }
}
```

## Unlinking

Use `bun unlink` in the root directory to unregister a local package.

```bash terminal icon="terminal"
cd /path/to/cool-pkg
bun unlink
```

```txt
bun unlink v1.x (7416672e)
```
