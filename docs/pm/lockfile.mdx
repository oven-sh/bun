Running `bun install` will create a lockfile called `bun.lock`.

#### Should it be committed to git?

Yes

#### Generate a lockfile without installing?

To generate a lockfile without installing to `node_modules` you can use the `--lockfile-only` flag. The lockfile will always be saved to disk, even if it is up-to-date with the `package.json`(s) for your project.

```bash terminal icon="terminal"
bun install --lockfile-only
```

<Note>
  Using `--lockfile-only` will still populate the global install cache with registry metadata and git/tarball
  dependencies.
</Note>

#### Can I opt out?

To install without creating a lockfile:

```bash terminal icon="terminal"
bun install --no-save
```

To install a Yarn lockfile _in addition_ to `bun.lock`.

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal icon="terminal"
bun install --yarn
```

```toml bunfig.toml icon="settings"
[install.lockfile]
# whether to save a non-Bun lockfile alongside bun.lock
# only "yarn" is supported
print = "yarn"
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Text-based lockfile

Bun v1.2 changed the default lockfile format to the text-based `bun.lock`. Existing binary `bun.lockb` lockfiles can be migrated to the new format by running `bun install --save-text-lockfile --frozen-lockfile --lockfile-only` and deleting `bun.lockb`.

More information about the new lockfile format can be found on [our blogpost](https://bun.com/blog/bun-lock-text-lockfile).

#### Automatic lockfile migration

When running `bun install` in a project without a `bun.lock`, Bun automatically migrates existing lockfiles:

- `yarn.lock` (v1)
- `package-lock.json` (npm)
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm)

The original lockfile is preserved and can be removed manually after verification.
