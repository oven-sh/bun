## Prerequisites

{% details summary="Extra notes for Bun Core Team Members" %}

Here are the extra steps I ran on my fresh windows machine (some of these are a little opiniated)

- Change user to a local account (set username to `window` and empty password)
  - (Empty password will disable the password and auto-login on boot)
- Set Windows Terminal as default terminal
- Install latest version of Powershell
- Display scale to 100%
- Remove McAfee and enable Windows Defender (default antivirus, does not nag you)
- Install Software
  - OpenSSH server (run these in an elevated terminal)
    - `Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0`
    - `Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0`
    - `Start-Service sshd`
    - `Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'`
    - `New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH" -Name DefaultShell -Value "C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe" -PropertyType String -Force`
    - Configure in `C:\ProgramData\ssh`
    - Add ssh keys (in ProgramData because it is an admin account)
  - Tailscale (login with GitHub so it joins the team tailnet)
  - Visual Studio Code
- Configure `git`
  - `git config user.name "your name"`
  - `git config user.email "your@email"`
- Disable sleep mode and the lid switch by going to "Power Options" and configuring everything there.

I recommend using VSCode through SSH instead of Tunnels or the Tailscale extension, it seems to be more reliable.

{% /details %}

Make sure to use powershell with the proper shell environment loaded. To do so, you can run:

```ps1
.\scripts\env.ps1
```

### Enable Scripts

By default, scripts are blocked.

```ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

### System Dependencies

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) with the "Desktop Development with C++" workload.
  - Install Git and CMake from here, if not already installed.

After Visual Studio, you need the following:

- LLVM 16
- Go
- Rust
- NASM
- Perl
- Ruby
- Node.js (until bun is stable enough on windows)

[Scoop](https://scoop.sh) can be used to install these easily.

```bash
scoop install nodejs-lts go rust nasm ruby perl
scoop llvm@16.0.4 # scoop bug if you install llvm and the rest at the same time
```

If you intend on building WebKit locally (optional), you should install some more packages:

```bash
scoop install make cygwin python
```

From here on out, it is **expected you use a Developer PowerShell Terminal with `.\scripts\env.ps1 sourced**. This script is available in the Bun repository and can be loaded by executing it.

```ps1
$ .\scripts\env.ps1
```

To verify, you can check for an MSVC-only command line such as `mt.exe`

```ps1
Get-Command mt
```

### Zig

Bun pins a version of Zig. As the compiler is still in development, breaking changes happen often that will break the build. It is recommended to use [Zigup](https://github.com/marler8997/zigup/releases) as it can quickly switch to any version by name, but you can also [manually download Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/).

```bash
$ zigup 0.12.0-dev.1604+caae40c21
```

{% callout %}
We last updated Zig on **October 26th, 2023**
{% /callout %}

### Codegen

On Unix platforms, we depend on an existing build of Bun to generate code for itself. Since the Windows build is not stable enough for this to run the code generators, you currently need to use another computer or WSL to generate this:

```bash
$ wsl --install # run twice if it doesnt install
# in the linux environment
$ sudo apt install unzip
$ curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Whenever codegen-related things are updated, please re-run

```ps1
$ .\scripts\codegen.ps1
```

## Building

```ps1
npm install

.\scripts\env.ps1
.\scripts\update-submodules.ps1
.\scripts\all-dependencies.ps1
.\scripts\codegen.ps1

cd build # this was created by the codegen.ps1 script in the prerequisites

cmake .. -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
ninja
```

If this was successful, you should have a `bun-debug.exe` in the `build` folder.

```ps1
.\bun-debug.exe --version
```

## Troubleshooting

### .rc file fails to build

`llvm-rc.exe` is odd. don't use it. use `rc.exe`, to do this make sure you are in a visual studio dev terminal, check `rc /?` to ensure it is `Microsoft Resource Compiler`

### failed to write output 'bun-debug.exe': permission denied

you cannot overwrite `bun-debug.exe` if it is already open. you likely have a running instance, maybe in the vscode debugger?
