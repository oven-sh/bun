description: Bun's roadmap and long-term plans
---

Bun is a project with an incredibly large scope and is still in its early days. Long-term, Bun aims to provide an all-in-one toolkit to replace the complex, fragmented toolchains common today: Node.js, Jest, Webpack, esbuild, Babel, yarn, PostCSS, etc.

Refer to [Bun's Roadmap](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/159) on GitHub to learn more about the project's long-term plans and priorities.
