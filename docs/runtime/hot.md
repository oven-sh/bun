ðŸš§ **Experimental** â€” Introduced in Bun v0.2.0.
{% /callout %}
Use `bun --hot` to enable hot reloading when executing code with Bun.

```bash
$ bun --hot server.ts
```

Starting from the entrypoint (`server.ts` in the example above), Bun builds a registry of all imported source files (excluding those in `node_modules`) and watches them for changes. When a change is detected, Bun performs a "soft reload". All files are re-evaluated, but all global state (notably, the `globalThis` object) is persisted.

```ts#server.ts
globalThis.count = globalThis.count ?? 0;
console.log(`Reloaded ${globalThis.count} times`);
globalThis.count++;

setInterval(function () {}, 1000000);
```

If you run this file with `bun --hot server.ts`, you'll see the reload count increment every time you save the file. The call to `setInterval` is there to prevent the process from exiting.

```bash
$ bun --hot index.ts
Reloaded 1 times
Reloaded 2 times
Reloaded 3 times
```

Traditional file watchers like `nodemon` restart the entire process, so HTTP servers and other stateful objects are lost. By contrast, `bun --hot` is able to reflect the updated code without restarting the process.

### HTTP servers

Bun provides the following simplified API for implementing HTTP servers. Refer to [API > HTTP](/docs/api/http) for full details.

```ts#server.ts
globalThis.count = globalThis.count ?? 0;
globalThis.count++;

export default {
  fetch(req: Request) {
    return new Response(`Reloaded ${globalThis.count} times`);
  },
  port: 3000,
};
```

The file above is simply exporting an object with a `fetch` handler defined. When this file is executed, Bun interprets this as an HTTP server and passes the exported object into `Bun.serve`.

Unlike an explicit call to `Bun.serve`, the object-based syntax works out of the box with `bun --hot`. When you save the file, your HTTP server be reloaded with the updated code without the process being restarted. This results in seriously fast refresh speeds.

For more fine-grained control, you can use the `Bun.serve` API directly and handle the server reloading manually.

```ts#server.ts
import type {Serve} from "bun";

globalThis.count = globalThis.count ?? 0;
globalThis.count++;

// define server parameters
const serverOptions: Serve = {
  port: 3000,
  fetch(req) {
    return new Response(`Reloaded ${globalThis.count} times`);
  }
};

if (!globalThis.server) {
  globalThis.server = Bun.serve(serverOptions);
} else {
  // reload server
  globalThis.server.reload(serverOptions);
}
```

**Note** â€” In a future version of Bun, support for Vite's `import.meta.hot` is planned to enable better lifecycle management for hot reloading and to align with the ecosystem.

{% details summary="Implementation `details`" %}

On reload, Bun:

- Resets the internal `require` cache and ES module registry (`Loader.registry`)
- Runs the garbage collector synchronously (to minimize memory leaks, at the cost of runtime performance)
- Re-transpiles all of your code from scratch (including sourcemaps)
- Re-evaluates the code with JavaScriptCore

This implementation isn't particularly optimized. It re-transpiles files that haven't changed. It makes no attempt at incremental compilation. It's a starting point.
