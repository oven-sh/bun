# Test File for CI Skip

This is a temporary test file to verify that PRs with only documentation changes don't trigger full CI builds.

This file should be deleted after testing PR #24459.

## Purpose

This PR is a draft that merges into PR #24459 to test the CI skip functionality.
When only files in the `docs/` directory are changed, the CI should skip running tests.
