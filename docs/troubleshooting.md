## Troubleshooting

### Bun not running on an M1 (or Apple Silicon)

If you see a message like this

> [1] 28447 killed bun create next ./test

It most likely means you’re running Bun’s x64 version on Apple Silicon. This happens if Bun is running via Rosetta. Rosetta is unable to emulate AVX2 instructions, which Bun indirectly uses.

The fix is to ensure you installed a version of Bun built for Apple Silicon.

### error: Unexpected

If you see an error like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/141210854-89434678-d21b-42f4-b65a-7df3b785f7b9.png)

It usually means the max number of open file descriptors is being explicitly set to a low number. By default, Bun requests the max number of file descriptors available (which on macOS, is something like 32,000). But, if you previously ran into ulimit issues with, e.g., Chokidar, someone on The Internet may have advised you to run `ulimit -n 8096`.

That advice unfortunately **lowers** the hard limit to `8096`. This can be a problem in large repositories or projects with lots of dependencies. Chokidar (and other watchers) don’t seem to call `setrlimit`, which means they’re reliant on the (much lower) soft limit.

To fix this issue:

1. Remove any scripts that call `ulimit -n` and restart your shell.
2. Try again, and if the error still occurs, try setting `ulimit -n` to an absurdly high number, such as `ulimit -n 2147483646`
3. Try again, and if that still doesn’t fix it, open an issue

### Unzip is required

Unzip is required to install Bun on Linux. You can use one of the following commands to install `unzip`:

#### Debian / Ubuntu / Mint

```sh
$ sudo apt install unzip
```

#### RedHat / CentOS / Fedora

```sh
$ sudo dnf install unzip
```

#### Arch / Manjaro

```sh
$ sudo pacman -S unzip
```

#### OpenSUSE

```sh
$ sudo zypper install unzip
```

### bun install is stuck

Please run `bun install --verbose 2> logs.txt` and send them to me in Bun's discord. If you're on Linux, it would also be helpful if you run `sudo perf trace bun install --silent` and attach the logs.

### Uninstalling

Bun's binary and install cache is located in `~/.bun` by default. To uninstall bun, delete this directory and edit your shell config (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or similar) to remove `~/.bun/bin` from the `$PATH` variable.

```sh
$ rm -rf ~/.bun # make sure to remove ~/.bun/bin from $PATH
```
