# Tell LLDB what to do when the debugged process receives SIGPWR: pass it through to the process
# (-p), but do not stop the process (-s) or notify the user (-n).
#
# JSC's garbage collector sends this signal (as configured by Bun WebKit in
# Thread::initializePlatformThreading() in ThreadingPOSIX.cpp) to the JS thread to suspend or resume
# it. So stopping the process would just create noise when debugging any long-running script.
