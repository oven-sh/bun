/**
 * **This module is pending deprecation.** Once a replacement API has been
 * finalized, this module will be fully deprecated. Most developers should
 * **not** have cause to use this module. Users who absolutely must have
 * the functionality that domains provide may rely on it for the time being
 * but should expect to have to migrate to a different solution
 * in the future.
 *
 * Domains provide a way to handle multiple different IO operations as a
 * single group. If any of the event emitters or callbacks registered to a
 * domain emit an `'error'` event, or throw an error, then the domain object
 * will be notified, rather than losing the context of the error in the`process.on('uncaughtException')` handler, or causing the program to
 * exit immediately with an error code.
 * @deprecated
 * @see [source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v18.0.0/lib/domain.js)
