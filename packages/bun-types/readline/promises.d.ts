     * The rl.question() method displays the query by writing it to the output, waits for user input to be provided on input,

   * The `readlinePromises.createInterface()` method creates a new `readlinePromises.Interface` instance.

   * const rl = readlinePromises.createInterface({
   *   input: process.stdin,
   *   output: process.stdout
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * Once the `readlinePromises.Interface` instance is created, the most common case is to listen for the `'line'` event:
   *
   * ```js
   * rl.on('line', (line) => {
   *   console.log(`Received: ${line}`);
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * If `terminal` is `true` for this instance then the `output` stream will get the best compatibility if it defines an `output.columns` property,
   * and emits a `'resize'` event on the `output`, if or when the columns ever change (`process.stdout` does this automatically when it is a TTY).
   *
   * ## Use of the `completer` function
   *
   * The `completer` function takes the current line entered by the user as an argument, and returns an `Array` with 2 entries:
   *
   * - An Array with matching entries for the completion.
   * - The substring that was used for the matching.
   *
   * For instance: `[[substr1, substr2, ...], originalsubstring]`.
   *
   * ```js
   * function completer(line) {
   *   const completions = '.help .error .exit .quit .q'.split(' ');
   *   const hits = completions.filter((c) => c.startsWith(line));
   *   // Show all completions if none found
   *   return [hits.length ? hits : completions, line];
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The `completer` function can also returns a `Promise`, or be asynchronous:
   *
   * ```js
   * async function completer(linePartial) {
   *   await someAsyncWork();
   *   return [['123'], linePartial];
   * }
   * ```
