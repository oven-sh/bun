//! This is a copy-pasta of std.Thread.Mutex with some changes.
//! - No assert with unreachable
//! - uses bun.Futex instead of std.Thread.Futex
//! Mutex is a synchronization primitive which enforces atomic access to a shared region of code known as the "critical section".
//! It does this by blocking ensuring only one thread is in the critical section at any given point in time by blocking the others.
//! Mutex can be statically initialized and is at most `@sizeOf(u64)` large.
//! Use `lock()` or `tryLock()` to enter the critical section and `unlock()` to leave it.
//!
//! Example:
//! ```
//! var m = Mutex{};
//!
//! {
//!     m.lock();
//!     defer m.unlock();
//!     // ... critical section code
//! }
//!
//! if (m.tryLock()) {
//!     defer m.unlock();
//!     // ... critical section code
//! }
//! ```
