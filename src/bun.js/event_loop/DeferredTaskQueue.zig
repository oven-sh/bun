//! Sometimes, you have work that will be scheduled, cancelled, and rescheduled multiple times
//! The order of that work may not particularly matter.
//!
//! An example of this is when writing to a file or network socket.
//!
//! You want to balance:
//!     1) Writing as much as possible to the file/socket in as few system calls as possible
//!     2) Writing to the file/socket as soon as possible
//!
//! That is a scheduling problem. How do you decide when to write to the file/socket? Developers
//! don't want to remember to call `flush` every time they write to a file/socket, but we don't
//! want them to have to think about buffering or not buffering either.
//!
//! Our answer to this is the DeferredTaskQueue.
//!
//! When you call write() when sending a streaming HTTP response, we don't actually write it immediately
//! by default. Instead, we wait until the end of the microtask queue to write it, unless either:
//!
//! - The buffer is full
//! - The developer calls `flush` manually
//!
//! But that means every time you call .write(), we have to check not only if the buffer is full, but also if
//! it previously had scheduled a write to the file/socket. So we use an ArrayHashMap to keep track of the
//! list of pointers which have a deferred task scheduled.
//!
//! The DeferredTaskQueue is drained after the microtask queue, but before other tasks are executed. This avoids re-entrancy
//! issues with the event loop.
