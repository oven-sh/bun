//! Centralized heap-pointer round-trip helpers.
//!
//! Zig's `bun.TrivialNew(@This())` / `bun.destroy(this)` / `bun.new(T, init)`
//! pattern was ported file-by-file as open-coded `Box::into_raw(Box::new(..))`
//! / `drop(Box::from_raw(..))` pairs (~1.8k occurrences). Per
//! `docs/RUST_PATTERNS.md` §5, every one of those is an unchecked ownership
//! transfer with the invariant restated in a `// SAFETY:` comment at every
//! site.
//!
//! These are **thin aliases** — they do not reduce per-site proof
//! obligations (each `take`/`destroy` is still its own `unsafe { }` block).
//! They exist for vocabulary consistency with the Zig spelling and as the
//! shared primitive *inside* the typed shims; they are NOT the safety
//! deliverable. The deliverable is the typed `Box<T>`-taking entry points
//! that own BOTH halves of the round-trip:
//!
//!   - `bun_threading::WorkPool::schedule_owned` / `OwnedTask`
//!   - `bun_event_loop::Task::from_boxed` / `ConcurrentTask::create_boxed`
//!   - `#[js_class]`-generated `T::to_js_boxed`
//!   - `bun_libuv_sys::UvHandle::set_owned_data` / `take_owned_data`
//!
//! New code should reach for one of those. Direct `heap::into_raw`/`heap::take`
//! calls are for the residual cases that don't fit a typed scheduler
//! (intrusive refcounts, self-referential payloads where the raw pointer is
//! observed after hand-off, FFI ownership protocols outside the four above).
//!
//! All four are `#[inline(always)]` no-ops — identical machine code to the
//! open-coded `Box::into_raw`/`from_raw`.
