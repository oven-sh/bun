## About TanStack Start

[TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest) is a full-stack framework powered by TanStack Router for React and Solid that provides:

- File-based routing
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Server functions with `createServerFn`
- Built-in data loading with route loaders
- Hot module replacement (HMR)

This project was created using `bun init --react=tanstack` in bun v{[bunVersion]s}. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
