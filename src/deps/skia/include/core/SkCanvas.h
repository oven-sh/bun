/** \class SkCanvas
    SkCanvas provides an interface for drawing, and how the drawing is clipped and transformed.
    SkCanvas contains a stack of SkMatrix and clip values.

    SkCanvas and SkPaint together provide the state to draw into SkSurface or SkBaseDevice.
    Each SkCanvas draw call transforms the geometry of the object by the concatenation of all
    SkMatrix values in the stack. The transformed geometry is clipped by the intersection
    of all of clip values in the stack. The SkCanvas draw calls use SkPaint to supply drawing
    state such as color, SkTypeface, text size, stroke width, SkShader and so on.

    To draw to a pixel-based destination, create raster surface or GPU surface.
    Request SkCanvas from SkSurface to obtain the interface to draw.
    SkCanvas generated by raster surface draws to memory visible to the CPU.
    SkCanvas generated by GPU surface uses Vulkan or OpenGL to draw to the GPU.

    To draw to a document, obtain SkCanvas from SVG canvas, document PDF, or SkPictureRecorder.
    SkDocument based SkCanvas and other SkCanvas subclasses reference SkBaseDevice describing the
    destination.

    SkCanvas can be constructed to draw to SkBitmap without first creating raster surface.
    This approach may be deprecated in the future.
