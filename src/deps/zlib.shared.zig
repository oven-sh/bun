The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of / the uncompressed data from that block has been written to strm->next_out. / The number of unused bits may in general be greater than seven, except / when bit 7 of data_type is set, in which case the number of unused bits / will be less than eight. data_type is set as noted here every time / inflate() returns for all flush options, and so can be used to determine / the amount of currently consumed input in bits.
