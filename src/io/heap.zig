/// An intrusive heap implementation backed by a pairing heap[1] implementation.
///
/// Why? Intrusive data structures require the element type to hold the metadata
/// required for the structure, rather than an additional container structure.
/// There are numerous pros/cons that are documented well by Boost[2]. For Zig,
/// I think the primary benefits are making data structures allocation free
/// (rather, shifting allocation up to the consumer which can choose how they
/// want the memory to be available). There are various costs to this such as
/// the costs of pointer chasing, larger memory overhead, requiring the element
/// type to be aware of its container, etc. But for certain use cases an intrusive
/// data structure can yield much better performance.
///
/// Usage notes:
/// - The element T is expected to have a field "heap" of type InstrusiveHeapField.
///   See the tests for a full example of how to set this.
/// - You can easily make this a min or max heap by inverting the result of
///   "less" below.
