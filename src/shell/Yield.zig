/// There are constraints on Bun's shell interpreter which are unique to shells in
/// general:
/// 1. We try to keep everything in the Bun process as much as possible for
///    performance reasons and also to leverage Bun's existing IO/FS code
/// 2. We try to use non-blocking operations as much as possible so the shell
///    does not interfere with the JS event loop
/// 3. Zig does not have coroutines (yet)
///
/// These cause two problems:
/// 1. Unbounded recursion, if we keep calling .next() on state machine structs
///    then the call stack could get really deep, we need some mechanism to allow
///    execution to continue without blowing up the call stack
///
/// 2. Correctly handling suspension points. These occur when IO would block so
///    we must, for example, wait for epoll/kqueue. The easiest solution is to have
///    functions return some value indicating that they suspended execution of the
///    interpreter.
///
/// This `Yield` struct solves these problems. It represents a "continuation" of
/// the shell interpreter. Shell interpreter functions must return this value.
/// At the top-level of execution, `Yield.run(...)` serves as a "trampoline" to
/// drive execution without blowing up the callstack.
///
/// Note that the "top-level of execution" could be in `Interpreter.run` or when
/// shell execution resumes after suspension in a task callback (for example in
/// IOWriter.onWritePoll).
