//! Copy of std.Thread.Condition, but uses Bun's Mutex and Futex.
//! Synchronized with std as of Zig 0.14.1.
//!
//! Condition variables are used with a Mutex to efficiently wait for an arbitrary condition to occur.
//! It does this by atomically unlocking the mutex, blocking the thread until notified, and finally re-locking the mutex.
//! Condition can be statically initialized and is at most `@sizeOf(u64)` large.
//!
//! Example:
//! ```
//! var m = Mutex{};
//! var c = Condition{};
//! var predicate = false;
//!
//! fn consumer() void {
//!     m.lock();
//!     defer m.unlock();
//!
//!     while (!predicate) {
//!         c.wait(&m);
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn producer() void {
//!     {
//!         m.lock();
//!         defer m.unlock();
//!         predicate = true;
//!     }
//!     c.signal();
//! }
//!
//! const thread = try std.Thread.spawn(.{}, producer, .{});
//! consumer();
//! thread.join();
//! ```
//!
//! Note that condition variables can only reliably unblock threads that are sequenced before them using the same Mutex.
//! This means that the following is allowed to deadlock:
//! ```
//! thread-1: mutex.lock()
//! thread-1: condition.wait(&mutex)
//!
//! thread-2: // mutex.lock() (without this, the following signal may not see the waiting thread-1)
//! thread-2: // mutex.unlock() (this is optional for correctness once locked above, as signal can be called while holding the mutex)
//! thread-2: condition.signal()
//! ```
