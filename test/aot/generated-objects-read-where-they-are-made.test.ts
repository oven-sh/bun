// Fixed seeds of fuzz/objects-read-where-they-are-made.ts: small functions that make a few small objects out of their own variables, go on changing them, and read their fields right there; some are seen from outside late, on one path alone.
// Each program is also built as a very large program is, and each executable also runs with a collection at every n-th allocation that leaves the fast path.
