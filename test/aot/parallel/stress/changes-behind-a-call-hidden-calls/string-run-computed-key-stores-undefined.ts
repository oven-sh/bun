// A typed caller reads an object, makes a call and reads it again. The toString method of an object that the callee uses as a property key stores undefined into a number field of the object.
// `strike` reads a field of a typed object. In the rounds of the damage that object is one whose field has become an accessor, so the read leaves its typed path, goes by name and runs the getter, which does the damage.
