// A typed caller reads an array, makes a call and reads it again. A generator, which a spread in the callee runs to its end, appends a fraction to an array that has held only small integers, which its type allows.
// `strike` reads a field of a typed object. In the rounds of the damage that object is one whose field has become an accessor, so the read leaves its typed path, goes by name and runs the getter, which does the damage.
