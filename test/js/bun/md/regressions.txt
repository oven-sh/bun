If from one side (and the other has no space/newline), replace new line with
space.

`
foo`
.
<p><code> foo</code></p>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example [no-normalize]

````````````````````````````````


## [Issue 248](https://github.com/mity/md4c/issues/248)

(These are in spec.txt, but we need the [no-normalize] flag in order to
catch the whitespace issues.)

```````````````````````````````` example [no-normalize]
#→Foo
.
<h1>Foo</h1>
````````````````````````````````

```````````````````````````````` example [no-normalize]

baz</em></h1>
````````````````````````````````


## [Issue 250](https://github.com/mity/md4c/issues/250)

Handling trailing tabulator character versus hard break.

Space + space + tab + newline is not hard break:
```````````````````````````````` example [no-normalize]
foo  →
bar
.
<p>foo
bar</p>
````````````````````````````````

Tab + space + space + newline is hard break:
```````````````````````````````` example [no-normalize]
foo→  
bar
.
<p>foo<br>
bar</p>
````````````````````````````````
