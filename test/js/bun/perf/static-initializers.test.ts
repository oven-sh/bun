/**
 * This test prevents startup performance regressions by ensuring that Bun has
 * exactly one static initializer from its own executable.
 *
 * Static initializers are functions that run automatically when a program starts, before main() is called.
 * They're used to initialize global variables and static class members, but come with performance costs:
 *
 * 1. They always execute at startup, even if the initialized values are never used
 * 2. They can't be optimized away by the compiler
 * 3. They add to the binary size
 * 4. They increase startup time
 * 5. They can introduce complex initialization order dependencies
 *
 * On macOS, we can use DYLD_PRINT_INITIALIZERS to detect static initializers.
 * This test verifies that Bun has exactly one static initializer from its own executable.
 *
 * Adding more static initializers would degrade Bun's startup performance.
