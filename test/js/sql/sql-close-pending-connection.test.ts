// A forced pool close (`close({ timeout: "0" })`) must resolve even when a
// pool connection has been accepted at the TCP level but the database
// handshake has not completed yet (a database that is still starting up).
// Previously the pending queries were rejected but the promise returned by
// close() stayed pending forever: the native close path emitted no socket
// event for in-flight connects, so the JS onclose callback never fired.
//
// connectionTimeout: 0 disables the connect timer, so close() is the only
// thing that can tear the connection down — without the fix these tests hang.
