These files are copied from https://github.com/190n/node/tree/napi-tests-bun, which in turn is a fork of Node.js with their js-native-api tests modified slightly to work in Bun.

To change these files, edit the Node.js fork and then copy the changed version here.

We should periodically (and definitely when we add new Node-API functions) sync that fork with Node.js upstream.
